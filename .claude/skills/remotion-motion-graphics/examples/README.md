# Examples

Four videos built with the remotion-motion-graphics skill, in one Remotion project. Claude Code produced each one by following the skill: theme object, five-layer scene stack, spring entrances, staggered timing, and the mandatory render, extract frames, inspect, fix, re-render loop. The audio comes from the scripts in `scripts/`, which synthesize every sound as a WAV; there are no asset downloads.

| Composition | What it is |
|---|---|
| `HaidrrrryPromo` | 12s profile promo: spark logo sting, word reveals, staggered cards, glow CTA |
| `FocusCatPromo` | 15.5s app promo: pixel-art mascot drawn in code (2-frame walk cycle), animated focus ring, synthesized SFX, warm ambient pad |
| `SelfFix` | 18.5s "watch this video fix itself": one scene opens deliberately bad (linear easing, flat background, no stagger, no grade) and upgrades live as each rule stamps in |
| `CodeEdit` | 20s beat-synced code edit: camera inside a syntax-glow code world, zoom punches on beats, RGB-split glitch pass, 3D code-shatter finale, original 120 BPM track |

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run audio            # writes deterministic 16-bit WAVs into public/sfx/
npm run studio           # browse all four in Remotion Studio
npm run render:focuscat  # or render:selffix / render:codeedit / render:profile
```

Verify the way the skill demands, by looking at extracted stills:

```bash
npx remotion still src/index.ts SelfFix out/check_300.png --frame 300 --overwrite
```

## Notes

- `src/theme.ts` (dark tech) and `src/focuscat/theme2.ts` (warm editorial) are the two palettes from `references/design-rules.md`.
- `src/focuscat/PixelCat.tsx` draws the mascot as a CSS pixel grid; swap the sprite strings to make your own.
